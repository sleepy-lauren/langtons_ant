# langtons_ant

This is an implementation of [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) cellular automaton.  This implementation allows one to choose the number of steps in each iteration, along with the color sequence to use.  Yes, I realize the code is a bit odd.  However, my friend hates OOP, so...I was attempting to make this less OO.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Here's an image from a 4-step, RLLR run:
